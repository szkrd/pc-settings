# PC settings "shortcuts"

In Windows 10 it's not possible to create shortcuts from the new settings
interface, items can only be pinned to the start menu.

If you are using [Classic Shell](www.classicshell.net/),
[Launchy](https://www.launchy.net/), or any other launch helper,
use these files to navigate to the new settings' sections.
